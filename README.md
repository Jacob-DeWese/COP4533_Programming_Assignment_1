Instructions to compile code (command line):
1. Download the zip file and extract.
2. Open the command prompt, and navigate to the location of the extracted program file and the cmake folder (e.g. 'cd C:\Users\user\Downloads\COP4533_Programming_Assignment_1-master\COP4533_Programming_Assignment_1-master\cmake-build-debug')
3. Run 'COP4533_Prog_Assi1.exe'
4. When prompted with the question of 'Matcher or Verifier?':
   a. To run matcher:
     i. Enter either 'Matcher', 'matcher', 'Match', or 'match'
     ii. State the input file you would like to run in this format: ..\input\inputStable1.txt
     ii. Find the similarly named output file (or provide a new output file name) in this format: ..\output\outputStable1.txt
     iii. When run, you should see the result of the Gale-Shapely algorithm and the output file in the output folder, and the time it took to run
   b. To run verifier:
     i. Make sure that the matcher has run first (unless you want to use some pre-created files)
     ii. Enter either 'Verifier', 'verifier', 'Verify', 'verify'
     iii. State the input file you would like to run in this format: ..\input\inputStable1.txt
     iv. Find the similarly named output file (or provide the output file name you used in the matcher) in this format: ..\output\outputStable1.txt
     v. When run, you should see the result of the verification, printing a result that confirms if it is valid and stable, invalid, or unstable, and the time it took to run


Input files (stored in the 'input' folder, manually created):

- inputSize4.txt (4 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize8.txt (8 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize16.txt (16 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize32.txt (32 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize64.txt (64 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize128.txt (128 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputSize256.txt (256 hospitals/students, Part C)
- inputStable1.txt (Matcher & verifier testing file)

Part C
After analyzing and graphing the execution times for both the matcher and verifier, we see the trend for the matcher is approximately linear (n) while the time complexity for the verifier looks approximately (n^x), where x≥2 and n represents the number of students/hospitals in the application pool. For both the matcher and verifier, we ran each method once for each size of students and hospitals to find an average run time for more accurate results. With these, we graphed the average run time to analyze what trends there were in the data, and compare them against the line of best fit (a linear representation that shows what a consistent linear growth for the data would be). For the matcher, the actual data points almost perfectly lined up with the line of best fit, which means that it can be represented by a linear growth. As for the verifier, the plotted points don’t line up with the line of best fit all too well, so a linear growth wouldn’t be a natural fit. Since we see slow growth at first followed by quick growth, we can assume that the minimum growth is exponential (n^2). We can be a bit more accurate and estimate a tighter range for what the true growth is, as since the growth isn’t too steep even after the number of hospitals/students doubles from 128 to 256, it likely isn’t going to be greater than cubic growth (n^3). So, we can estimate that the growth of the verifier is n^2≤n^3. However, for simplicity sake, we can conclude that the growth of the matcher is linear (n) and the verifier is at least exponential (n^x,x≥2), likely in between exponential and cubic growth.
